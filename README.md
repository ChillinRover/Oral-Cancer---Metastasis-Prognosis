# Oral-Cancer---Metastasis-Prognosis

This project was made while helping a teacher at IBILI - http://www.uc.pt/en/fmuc/ibili . I cannot share the data I used, but it consisted on an analysis of several regions of one gene. The objective was to predict through this gene data, if a patient had more chance that his cancer would metastize. Since i cannot share the data, I also added the .html with the final results.
